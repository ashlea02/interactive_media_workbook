<!-- THIS PROJECT HAS REILED HEAVILY ON COPILOT. IT HAS ANTICIPATED MY CODE, AND I HAVE USED THE AUTO-FILL FEATURES OFTEN,
I HAVE ALSO COPIED LOTS OF CODE FROM IT (MY CSS FOR EXAMPLE), BUT I HAVE OFTEN ASKED IT TO EXPLAIN CODE TO ME. WHILE 
I HAVE USED MUCH OF ITS CODE, I HAVE ALSO TWEAKED IT TO SUIT MY NEEDS - I HAVE LEARNT WHICH VARIABLES CONTROL WHAT. 
IT HAS BEEN A LEARNING TOOL IN THIS WAY AS I HAVE LEARNT THE LANGUAGE, AND WHAT TO ASK FOR TO GET THE RESULTS I WANT.
IT HAS ALSO OFFERED ME IDEAS WHY MY CODE MAY NOT WORK AT TIMES. ALL COPY HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY MYSELF ONLY -->
